# Update Equity Trade Adjusted Minute Bars

## Introduction

algoseek's Equity Trade Adjusted Minute Bars dataset is organized by SecID - a unique identifier
for each equity security that remains unchanged even during a name or ticker changes.
The data is partitioned into buckets by year, so each bucket has one csv.gz file per SecID.

The dataset uses backward adjustment approach.
It means that any new corporate events trigger the entire stock history change.
Also the entire dataset is updated on daily basis with bars for the previous trading session.
As the result, you will need to update ~10000 symbols due to daily updates and ~300 symbols affected by corporate events.

When working with the full universe of symbols, getting all these changes requires fetching Gigabytes of data daily.
Having data partitioned by year reduces the amount to be downloaded but
on the other hand, it is convenient to have one file per SecID when working with data.
This script allows getting updates for the data partitioned by year and merging it into a dataset with a single file per SecID.

Also, this script allows getting updates for the data aggregated by trade date and partitioned by year.
Please note that for this aggregation you cannot do any aggregations by ticker or SecId. Such option is available just for data aggregated by SecId.

Currently, can be used for buckets: us-equity-1min-trades-adjusted-secid-yyyy, us-equity-1min-trades-adjusted-yyyy, and us-equity-cumulative-backward-adjustment-secid-yyyy.

**Note:** if you are not using named AWS profiles and have just one pair of AWS keys configured you don't need to use the `profile` option.

**Note:** if you are working with a list of tickers/secids you have to use just one optional argument --tickers/--secids or --tickers_file/--secids_file.

**Note:** if you are using the file with tickers or secids, it should be one column with tickers or secids without header.
